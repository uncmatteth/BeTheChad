## Current In-Progress Task

### MP3 Optimization and Hosting Migration

The current MP3 implementation has these issues:
- Large MP3 files (3-5MB each) in the repository 
- High bandwidth usage when streamed directly from the server
- Potential increased costs on Render.com due to bandwidth usage

**Planned solution:**
1. Optimize MP3 files to 160kbps (reducing size by ~50% while maintaining quality)
2. Move MP3 hosting to NameCheap (already paid for hosting)
3. Implement Cloudflare CDN integration (free) for better performance
4. Update app code to use the new MP3 locations

**Implementation status:** Planning completed, awaiting implementation

## Future Plans

### 1. Twitter API v2 Upgrade

The current Twitter API implementation needs to be updated to v2. A detailed plan has been created in [TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md) with the following key components:

- Update authentication flow to OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- Migrate all endpoints to their v2 equivalents
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- Add comprehensive testing for all Twitter functionality

### 2. Blockchain Integration

The current blockchain implementation is simulated and needs to be replaced with actual Solana integration. A detailed plan has been created in [BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) with the following key components:

- Implement wallet connectivity for popular Solana wallets
- Create NFT functionality for game assets
- Develop and deploy smart contracts for game mechanics
- Build transaction management and monitoring systems

### 3. Music Player Improvements

The music player is now functional, but several improvements could be made:

- Add track progress visualization
- Implement lazy loading for improved performance
- Add keyboard shortcuts for player control
- Consider offline playback capability

## Deployment Status

The latest changes have been:
1. Committed to the Git repository
2. Pushed to GitHub
3. Automatically deployed to Render.com

The live site (https://chadbattles.fun) should reflect all these changes once Render completes the deployment.

## Verification Process

To verify the latest changes:

1. **Music Player**
   - Follow the verification process in [MUSIC_PLAYER_VERIFICATION.md](MUSIC_PLAYER_VERIFICATION.md)
   - Run the verification script: `python verify_music_player.py --prod`

2. **Placeholder Images**
   - Check that all image references in templates resolve correctly
   - Verify that no 404 errors appear in the browser console for images

## Documentation

The following documentation has been created or updated:

- [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Current project status and recent changes
- [MUSIC_PLAYER_VERIFICATION.md](MUSIC_PLAYER_VERIFICATION.md) - Music player verification process
- [TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md) - Plan for Twitter API upgrade
- [BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) - Plan for blockchain integration
- [README.md](README.md) - Updated with latest features and documentation links
- [MP3_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](MP3_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md) - Detailed plan for MP3 optimization and hosting migration

## Next Steps

1. **Implement MP3 optimization and hosting migration**
   - Optimize all 104 MP3 files to 160kbps format
   - Upload files to NameCheap hosting
   - Set up Cloudflare CDN integration
   - Update app code to reference new file locations

2. Verify all changes on the live site
3. Begin implementation of Twitter API v2 upgrade
4. Start planning for blockchain integration
5. Continue monitoring for any issues or user feedback

All tasks from the WEBSITE_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md have been completed, and the website should now be fully functional with proper music player functionality and placeholder images for all game assets.
