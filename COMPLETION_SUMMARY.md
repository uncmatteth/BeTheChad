## Future Plans

### 1. Twitter API v2 Upgrade

The current Twitter API implementation needs to be updated to v2. A detailed plan has been created in [TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](TWITTER_API_V2_UPGRADE_PLAN.md) with the following key components:

- Update authentication flow to OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- Migrate all endpoints to their v2 equivalents
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- Add comprehensive testing for all Twitter functionality

### 2. Blockchain Integration

The current blockchain implementation is simulated and needs to be replaced with actual Solana integration. A detailed plan has been created in [BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) with the following key components:

- Implement wallet connectivity for popular Solana wallets
- Create NFT functionality for game assets
- Develop and deploy smart contracts for game mechanics
- Build transaction management and monitoring systems

### 3. Music Player Improvements

The music player is now functional, but several improvements could be made:

- Add track progress visualization
- Implement lazy loading for improved performance
- Add keyboard shortcuts for player control
- Consider offline playback capability
