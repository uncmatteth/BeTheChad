# Marketplace Removal and Multi-Wallet Support

This document summarizes the changes made to remove the internal marketplace functionality and add support for multiple Solana wallets.

## Marketplace Removal

The internal marketplace functionality has been removed in favor of using third-party marketplaces for NFT trading. This simplifies our codebase and reduces potential security and regulatory concerns.

### Files Removed
- `app/controllers/marketplace.py` - Marketplace controller
- `app/templates/marketplace/index.html` - Marketplace template

### Database Changes
- Removed `is_listed`, `current_price`, and `listed_at` fields from the `NFT` model
- Removed `ix_nft_is_listed` index from the database

### Code Changes
- Removed marketplace-related methods from the `NFT` model (`list_for_sale`, `unlist`)
- Removed marketplace-related methods from the `Transaction` model (`create_marketplace_purchase`, `get_marketplace_transactions`)
- Removed `MARKETPLACE_PURCHASE` transaction type
- Removed marketplace-related methods from the `User` model (`get_marketplace_listings`)
- Removed marketplace link from the navigation menu
- Updated dashboard to remove marketplace link and add text about third-party marketplaces
- Removed marketplace-related API endpoints

## Multi-Wallet Support

Support for multiple Solana wallets has been added to enhance user experience and provide more options for blockchain interaction.

### Supported Wallets
- Phantom
- Solflare
- Metamask (with Solana support)
- Magic Eden

### Database Changes
- Added `wallet_type` field to the `User` model

### Code Changes
- Updated the wallet connection UI to show a modal with wallet options
- Added wallet-specific connection logic for each supported wallet
- Updated the auth controller to handle wallet type parameter
- Added CSS styling for the wallet connection UI
- Created a directory structure for wallet images

### UI Enhancements
- Added a modal for wallet selection
- Improved wallet connection feedback
- Added wallet type display in the UI

## Migration

A database migration has been created to:
1. Add the `wallet_type` column to the `user` table
2. Remove marketplace-related fields from the `nft` table
3. Remove marketplace-related indices

To apply these changes, run:
```
flask db upgrade
```
