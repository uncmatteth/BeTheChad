- ✅ Transaction history tracking
- ✅ Multi-wallet support (Phantom, Solflare, Metamask, Magic Eden, Slope)
- ✅ 1% royalty on NFT transactions

### User Interface
- ✅ Inventory integration with mint buttons
- ✅ NFT details view
- ✅ Transaction history page
- ✅ Wallet connection modal
- ✅ Minting confirmation modal
- ✅ Notification system for minting and burning operations

### Backend Services
- ✅ API endpoints for minting and burning NFTs
- ✅ Wallet connection and disconnection endpoints
- ✅ Metadata generation and storage utilities
- ✅ NFT value calculation for burning rewards
- ✅ Environment setup script for cross-environment compatibility

### Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for NFT functionality
- ✅ Mock wallet and blockchain interactions for testing
- ✅ Test data generation for different entity types

- Wallet address and type stored in the user model

### Transaction History
- Comprehensive transaction history for all NFT operations
- Filtering by transaction type (mint, burn, transfer)
- Details include date, type, description, amount, and transaction hash

## Environment Support

The NFT system is designed to work across all environments:

### Development
- Local metadata storage
- Simulated blockchain interactions
- Easy setup for development testing

### Testing
- Separate test database and metadata storage
- Mock wallet and blockchain interactions
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Production
- Secure metadata storage
- Real blockchain interactions
- Performance optimizations

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the NFT system include:

1. **Marketplace Integration**: Direct integration with popular Solana marketplaces
2. **NFT Staking**: Allow users to stake NFTs for passive Chadcoin rewards
3. **NFT Breeding**: Combine two waifus to create a new waifu with inherited traits
4. **NFT Quests**: Special missions only available to NFT holders
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed analytics for NFT trading and value
