## Notes
- All changes should follow the established coding patterns
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Keep documentation up to date

## Environment Information
- Development: Local Flask server
- Test: Local test environment
- Production: Render.com deployment

## Development Standards

### Coding Patterns
- Keep solutions simple and straightforward
- Avoid code duplication by checking for existing similar functionality
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Only make well-understood, requested changes
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when introducing new ones
- Keep codebase clean and organized
- Avoid one-off scripts in files
- Keep files under 200-300 lines; refactor when exceeded
- Use mocking only in tests, never in dev or prod
- Never add stubbing/fake data patterns in dev or prod
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation
- Complete tasks fully without templates or placeholders
- Create actual files, never samples or placeholders

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Python
- Frontend: HTML/JS
- Database: SQL (no JSON file storage)
- Environment-specific databases (dev, test, prod)
- Search: Elasticsearch via elastic.co hosting
- Search indexes: Separate dev and prod
- Testing: Python test framework

### Development Workflow
- Focus on task-relevant code areas
- Avoid touching unrelated code
- Write thorough tests for major functionality
- Always test implemented features
- Preserve working feature patterns unless instructed otherwise
- Consider impacts on related code areas
- Deliver only complete, functional, tested code

### Environment-Specific Notes
- PowerShell commands:
  - Do not use `&&` for command chaining (not supported)
  - Use separate commands or PowerShell-specific syntax
  - Example: Instead of `command1 && command2`, run commands separately
  - For complex operations, consider creating PowerShell scripts
- Admin Privileges:
  - When encountering permission issues, ask user to run with admin privileges
  - This is preferable to using `--user` flag for installations
  - Helps avoid path and permission complications
