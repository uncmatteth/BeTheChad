- [ ] Document security practices
- [ ] Create user guide for music system

### 7. Frontend Improvements
- [ ] Add loading states for better user feedback
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery for failed tracks
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for player control
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add visual feedback for player actions

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider implementing offline playback capability
- [ ] Add support for user playlists
- [ ] Implement audio visualization
- [ ] Add social sharing features
- [ ] Consider implementing a recommendation system

## Notes
- All changes should follow the established coding patterns
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Keep documentation up to date

## Environment Information
- Development: Local Flask server
- Test: Local test environment
- Production: Render.com deployment

## Development Standards

### Coding Patterns
- Keep solutions simple and straightforward
- Avoid code duplication by checking for existing similar functionality
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Only make well-understood, requested changes
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when introducing new ones
- Keep codebase clean and organized
- Avoid one-off scripts in files
- Keep files under 200-300 lines; refactor when exceeded
- Use mocking only in tests, never in dev or prod
- Never add stubbing/fake data patterns in dev or prod
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation
- Complete tasks fully without templates or placeholders
- Create actual files, never samples or placeholders

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Python
- Frontend: HTML/JS
- Database: SQL (no JSON file storage)
- Environment-specific databases (dev, test, prod)
- Search: Elasticsearch via elastic.co hosting
- Search indexes: Separate dev and prod
- Testing: Python test framework

### Development Workflow
- Focus on task-relevant code areas
- Avoid touching unrelated code
- Write thorough tests for major functionality
- Always test implemented features
- Preserve working feature patterns unless instructed otherwise
- Consider impacts on related code areas
- Deliver only complete, functional, tested code
