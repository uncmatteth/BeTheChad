   - Robust initialization script
   - Fixed model relationship issues (Referral-Chad relationship with explicit primaryjoin)
7. Route structure updated:
   - Created proper route files in app/routes
   - Fixed missing module errors
   - Added model attributes for battle and cabal
   - Fixed broken route import (BattleResult)
   - Fixed leaderboard route with robust error handling
8. Character classes expanded:

   - Created placeholder images for all new classes
   - Updated database initialization script
9. Anti-cheating system implemented:

   - Added Blockchain Detective as a rare special class
   - Implemented tweet timestamp analysis to detect suspicious patterns
   - Created class appeal system for the Blockchain Detective class

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- Music files MUST be hosted on nameserver (`/home/chadszv/public_html/music`) NOT on Render
- Always test PostgreSQL database operations, avoid SQLite even in development
- Check for correct URLs in all templates (especially for music and API endpoints)
- Templates must extend from base.html and implement required blocks
- Update both checklists before committing changes
- Render deployments are triggered automatically by git pushes
- Use hardcoded fallbacks for critical resources when filesystem access might fail
- When changing app structure, ensure all necessary files are created (routes, models, etc.)
- Render deployment requires proper route files in app/routes directory
- Models must include all attributes referenced in controllers
- All model relationships with self-referential foreign keys need explicit primaryjoin conditions

Next priority tasks (in recommended order):
1. Fix Twitter OAuth callback URL in the Twitter developer dashboard
2. Add admin interface for managing class appeals
3. Run and fix any failing tests (Testing)
4. Improve mobile responsiveness (Frontend)
5. Create comprehensive API documentation (Documentation)

Remember to:
- Update this checklist after completing each task
- Commit and push changes regularly
- Follow the Development Standards section strictly
- Write thorough tests for all new features
- Document all significant changes

## Notes
- All changes should follow the established coding patterns
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Keep documentation up to date

## Environment Information
- Development: Local Flask server
- Test: Local test environment
- Production: Render.com deployment

## Development Standards

### Coding Patterns
- Keep solutions simple and straightforward
- Avoid code duplication by checking for existing similar functionality
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Only make well-understood, requested changes
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when introducing new ones
- Keep codebase clean and organized
- Avoid one-off scripts in files
- Keep files under 200-300 lines; refactor when exceeded
- Use mocking only in tests, never in dev or prod
- Never add stubbing/fake data patterns in dev or prod
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation
- Complete tasks fully without templates or placeholders
- Create actual files, never samples or placeholders

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Python
- Frontend: HTML/JS
- Database: SQL (no JSON file storage)
- Environment-specific databases (dev, test, prod)
- Search: Elasticsearch via elastic.co hosting
- Search indexes: Separate dev and prod
- Testing: Python test framework

### Development Workflow
- Focus on task-relevant code areas
- Avoid touching unrelated code
- Write thorough tests for major functionality
- Always test implemented features
- Preserve working feature patterns unless instructed otherwise
- Consider impacts on related code areas
- Deliver only complete, functional, tested code

### Environment-Specific Notes
- PowerShell commands:
  - Do not use `&&` for command chaining (not supported)
  - Use separate commands or PowerShell-specific syntax
  - Example: Instead of `command1 && command2`, run commands separately
  - For complex operations, consider creating PowerShell scripts
- Admin Privileges:
  - When encountering permission issues, ask user to run with admin privileges
  - This is preferable to using `--user` flag for installations
  - Helps avoid path and permission complications
