3. Automatically deployed to Render.com

The live site should reflect all these changes once Render completes the deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Verify the music player works on the live site (chadbattles.fun)
   - Follow the verification process outlined in MUSIC_PLAYER_VERIFICATION.md
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices
   - Check for any console errors or performance issues
2. Monitor for any additional issues or user feedback
3. Consider implementing music player improvements:
   - Add track progress visualization
   - Implement lazy loading for improved performance
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for player control
   - Consider offline playback capability

## Environment Information
- Development: Local Flask server with debug mode
- Test: Local database (postgresql://localhost/chad_battles)
- Production: Render.com (https://chad-battles-grdu.onrender.com/ and https://chadbattles.fun)

## Project Overview
Chad Battles is a web-based game with social media integration that allows players to control "Chad" characters and battle other Chads. The game combines RPG elements with NFT functionality on the Solana blockchain. The application is built with Python/Flask for the backend and uses SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production) for the database.

```

## Environment Configuration
The application is using a SQLite database (`test.db`) for development, as specified in the `.env` file:
```
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test.db
SECRET_KEY=dev-key-change-in-production
```

## NFT System Implementation
The NFT system allows players to mint Chad characters, waifus, and items as NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Key components include:

1. **Models:**
   - `NFT`: Tracks the NFT token information, entity relationships, and metadata
   - `Transaction`: Records all NFT-related transactions (minting, burning, transfers)

2. **Controllers:**
   - `nft_bp`: Handles NFT listing, viewing, and transaction history
   - `api_bp`: Manages minting and blockchain interactions

3. **Features:**
   - Minting game entities as NFTs
   - Viewing NFT metadata and details
   - Tracking transaction history
   - Burning NFTs for in-game rewards
   - Wallet connection for blockchain operations

## Getting Started

### For Development:
1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements_sqlite.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize directories and sample files:**
   ```
   python setup_environment.py
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

### For Production:
Follow the steps in `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for deploying to Render.com.

## Known Issues and Next Steps
1. **Dependency Conflicts:**
   - We've resolved the initial conflicts between `solana` and `solders` packages
   - Some packages may need further adjustment depending on usage patterns

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Currently using SQLite for development
   - Additional setup needed for PostgreSQL in production

3. **NFT Implementation:**
   - Metadata directory structure has been created

4. **Testing:**
   - Comprehensive testing across test, development, and production environments is needed
   - Mock wallet and blockchain interactions for testing should be implemented
