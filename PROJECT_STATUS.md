# Chad Battles Project Status

## Project Overview
Chad Battles is a web-based game with social media integration that allows players to control "Chad" characters and battle other Chads. The game combines RPG elements with NFT functionality on the Solana blockchain. The application is built with Python/Flask for the backend and uses SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production) for the database.

## Current Status
We've successfully set up the development environment and addressed dependency conflicts:
- Fixed compatibility issues between `solana` and `solders` packages
- Updated `requirements_sqlite.txt` to ensure compatible versions
- Created the necessary environment for NFT metadata and wallet functionality
- Initialized the database for local development

```

## Environment Configuration
The application is using a SQLite database (`test.db`) for development, as specified in the `.env` file:
```
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test.db
SECRET_KEY=dev-key-change-in-production
```

## NFT System Implementation
The NFT system allows players to mint Chad characters, waifus, and items as NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Key components include:

1. **Models:**
   - `NFT`: Tracks the NFT token information, entity relationships, and metadata
   - `Transaction`: Records all NFT-related transactions (minting, burning, transfers)

2. **Controllers:**
   - `nft_bp`: Handles NFT listing, viewing, and transaction history
   - `api_bp`: Manages minting and blockchain interactions

3. **Features:**
   - Minting game entities as NFTs
   - Viewing NFT metadata and details
   - Tracking transaction history
   - Burning NFTs for in-game rewards
   - Wallet connection for blockchain operations

## Getting Started

### For Development:
1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements_sqlite.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize directories and sample files:**
   ```
   python setup_environment.py
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

### For Production:
Follow the steps in `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for deploying to Render.com.

## Known Issues and Next Steps
1. **Dependency Conflicts:**
   - We've resolved the initial conflicts between `solana` and `solders` packages
   - Some packages may need further adjustment depending on usage patterns

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Currently using SQLite for development
   - Additional setup needed for PostgreSQL in production

3. **NFT Implementation:**
   - Metadata directory structure has been created
   - Wallet integration requires proper API keys for production

4. **Testing:**
   - Comprehensive testing across test, development, and production environments is needed
   - Mock wallet and blockchain interactions for testing should be implemented

## Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **Database:** SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Blockchain:** Solana
- **Frontend:** HTML/JS/CSS
- **Social Media Integration:** Twitter API
