All documentation should follow these standards:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - `/docs/deployment/` - All deployment-related documentation
   - `/docs/features/` - Feature-specific documentation
   - `/docs/qa_testing/` - QA and testing documentation
   - Root directory - Only key project-wide documentation

2. **File Organization**: 
   - Each directory has an `index.md` file explaining its contents
   - Related documents are grouped in the same directory
   - Authoritative documents are clearly indicated

3. **Updating**: When modifying a feature, always update the corresponding documentation

4. **Checklists**: Mark items as completed using "[x]" syntax and incomplete items with "[ ]"

5. **Deprecation**: Never delete documentation; instead, move it to the Deprecated section and refer to the replacement
