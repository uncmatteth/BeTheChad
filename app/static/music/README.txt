CHAD BATTLES MUSIC PLAYER
========================

To add music to your Chad Battles music player:

1. Place your MP3 files in this directory (app/static/music/)
2. Name your files with underscores instead of spaces (e.g., "awesome_track.mp3")
3. Restart the application or refresh the page

The music player will automatically detect and load all MP3 files in this directory.

Tips for naming your files:
- Use descriptive names as they will appear in the player
- Underscores (_) will be displayed as spaces in the player interface
- Keep filenames relatively short for better display in the player

Enjoy your music!
