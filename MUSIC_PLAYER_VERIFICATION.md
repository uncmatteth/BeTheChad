## Current Status

The music player has been implemented with the following features:
- 104 "Be the Chad" MP3 files added to the repository
- MP3 files included in Git tracking (modified .gitignore)
- Randomized playback of tracks
- Play/pause, next/previous, and volume controls
- Persistence between page loads using localStorage
- Togglable interface that can be hidden/shown

## Deployment Verification Checklist

To verify that the music player is working correctly on the live site (https://chadbattles.fun):

- [ ] Music player appears at the bottom of the page
- [ ] Music list API endpoint (/music/list) returns the full list of tracks
- [ ] Player successfully loads and plays music files
- [ ] Controls (play/pause, next/previous, volume) work as expected
- [ ] Player persists state between page navigation
- [ ] Player works on mobile devices

## Testing Instructions

   - Next/previous buttons change tracks
   - Volume slider adjusts volume
   - Player remembers state when navigating to different pages
5. Check browser console for any errors
6. Test on different devices and browsers

- [ ] Add performance tracking for efficient audio playback

## Notes and Findings

The music player implementation appears to be complete as per the WEBSITE_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md. All 104 "Be the Chad" MP3 files have been added to the repository and should be accessible on the live site after deployment by Render.com.

To check deployment status, you can:
1. Visit the Render dashboard
2. Check recent deployments in the project settings
3. View logs to confirm the music files were successfully deployed

All changes have been committed to the repository and pushed to GitHub, so Render should automatically deploy these changes.
